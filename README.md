# IMPMD: An integrated method for predicting potential associations between miRNAs and diseases

## Requirements
* Matlab2016a

## File description
* There are two subfiles in the file named Feature construction for feature encoding and feature extraction.
* There are four subfolders in the folder named Predictors,which are the code of the four predictors. The predictors  are based on SVM, LR, KNN and the combination of these three algorithms, respectively.
* In the folder named Similarity is the code that calculates the enhanced similarity representation of diseases and miRNAs.
